## Coding School Networking Example

This project is a simple networking example for the Coding School at Wörthersee. It demonstrates how to interact with a REST API using JavaScript's Fetch API. The project is structured around a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation on "elements".

### API Documentation

- You can find the Swagger documentation for this project [here](https://coding-school-networking.dev.webundsoehne.com/internal/docs).

### Project Structure

- [`src/index.html`](src/index.html): The main HTML file.
- [`src/script.js`](src/script.js): The main JavaScript file where all the logic resides.
- [`src/input.css`](src/input.css): The CSS file for input styling.
- [`src/output.css`](src/output.css): The CSS file generated by Tailwind.
- [`tailwind.config.js`](tailwind.config.js): The configuration file for Tailwind CSS.

### Key Functions

- [`login()`](src/script.js): This function is triggered when the login form is submitted. It sets the user data from the form fields and loads the elements.
- [`getElements()`](src/script.js): This function sends a GET request to the API to fetch all elements. It then creates a card for each element using the [`createElementCard()`](src/script.js) function and appends it to the container.
- [`postElement(name, description)`](src/script.js): This function sends a POST request to the API to create a new element with the given name and description.
- [`deleteElement(id)`](src/script.js): This function sends a DELETE request to the API to delete the element with the given id.
- [`createElementCard(element)`](src/script.js): This function creates a card for a given element. The card includes the element's name, description, and a delete button.

### How to Use

- Open [`src/index.html`](src/index.html) in your browser.
- Enter your username and password in the login form and submit.
- You will see a list of elements. You can create a new element by filling out the create new element form.
- To delete an element, click the "✕" button on the card of the element you want to delete.
